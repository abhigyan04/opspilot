# OpsPilot

An evaluation-driven incident investigation agent for the fictional Acme
Commerce platform. The agent investigates synthetic incidents through a bounded
loop, selecting operational tools with model-generated, validated arguments
and feeding their results back into subsequent decisions. It then generates a
structured diagnosis and validates its evidence references.

## Run locally

From the repository root, using Python 3.10 or newer:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
ollama pull qwen3:4b
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.agent.agent
```

Ollama must be running locally. The example incident explicitly identifies
`checkout-service`; the agent prints JSON containing `investigation` and
`diagnosis` records.

## Investigation loop

Each iteration passes the incident and conversation history to Qwen3. The
model selects a tool or chooses `finish`. Tool decisions are validated before
execution, and their results are appended to the history so later decisions
can use discovered information, such as a deployment's commit hash.

`investigate(incident, max_steps=6)` allows up to six model decisions by
default. A `finish` decision counts toward this limit and does not execute a
tool. The `investigation` record contains:

- `status`: `finished` when the model chooses to stop, or `step_limit` when
  the decision limit is exhausted.
- `reason`: the model's stopping explanation or the step-limit message.
- `steps`: the execution history, with each tool's decision (name, arguments,
  and reason), returned result, and Python-generated `evidence_id`.

Evidence IDs identify entire tool responses, including empty responses, and
are local to each investigation. The model receives these same IDs alongside
the observations in its conversation history.

Each tool has a Pydantic argument schema, selected through the `tool`
discriminator. Invalid tool names, missing required fields, invalid log levels,
and extra fields are rejected before dispatch. `query_metrics` takes
`service` and `metric_name`, currently restricted to `error_rate`;
`search_logs` requires both `service` and `level`.

The prompt tells the model to use only available information. Schema validation
checks argument structure, but does not prove that values are supported by
evidence. A `finished` status records the model's choice to stop; it does not
certify a diagnosis. The model may still overstate conclusions in its stopping
reason.

## Structured diagnosis

After investigation, a separate model call assesses the collected tool
observations. It receives the incident, evidence IDs, tool names, arguments,
and results, without the investigation model's earlier reasoning or stopping
explanation.

The diagnosis returns either:

- `supported`: a proposed root cause, supporting claims with evidence
  citations, and limitations.
- `insufficient_evidence`: a reason and a list of missing evidence.

Python checks every root-cause and supporting-claim citation against IDs
collected during that investigation. Unknown IDs raise `ValueError`.
With no collected steps, diagnosis returns insufficient evidence without
calling the model.

Diagnosis also runs after the investigation reaches its step limit. The
default run permits six investigation decisions plus one diagnosis call.

Citation validation checks that references exist; it does not prove that
the evidence supports the claim. The `supported` status is the model's
assessment. A live run incorrectly described the refactor as causing
`request.user` to become `None`, rather than introducing an access that fails
when it is already `None`. Diagnosis accuracy remains an evaluation concern.

The agent does not perform remediation.

## Tests

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

Tests use synthetic fixtures and mocked model responses, so Ollama is not
required for the test suite. Run commands from the repository root because the
tools currently resolve fixture paths relative to the working directory.

Tests cover argument validation and dispatch, passing tool evidence to the next
decision, finishing without executing a tool, and enforcing the step limit.
They also cover diagnosis schemas, acceptance of collected evidence IDs,
rejection of unknown citations, the observations sent to diagnosis generation,
and the no-evidence fallback without a model call. These deterministic tests
verify orchestration and citation integrity, not model diagnosis accuracy.

## Next milestone

Add human-approved remediation, starting with a structured proposal and
explicit approval before simulated execution. Keep diagnosis accuracy and
unsupported causal claims visible as evaluation concerns.
